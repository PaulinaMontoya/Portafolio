          <p className="aboutMe">I studied graphic design and I consider myself as a creative person always thinking how to do a better process in my work. I have experience creating brands and designing the frameworks to web pages, e-commerces, landing pages and movile apps to Android and iOS. Therefor, now I'm learning programming to complement those skills.
In the last 3 years I started my path to specialize me in web development on my own taking workshops, online courses and getting into Laboratoria's bootcamp as front-end develper.
I really enjoy team work because the feedback of colleagues improve my work and inspire me to keep learning.
<br/>
<span className="spanContact" >I love maintain my soul creative looking for new trends in design, art and new technologies.</span></p>
